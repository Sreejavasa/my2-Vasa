# Sreeja Vasa
I am an avid learner with a deep passion for antiques, archaeology, and the mysteries of the universe. Alongside my love for these subjects, I have a strong affinity for music and consider myself a skilled singer. My ultimate goal is to become self-reliant and make my parents proud through my achievements in life.
